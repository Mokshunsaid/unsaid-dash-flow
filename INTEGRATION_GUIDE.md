# 🚀 UnsaidTalks Mock Server Integration Guide

## ✅ Current Status

Your Postman mock server is set up at:
**https://caea2572-638c-4052-b6d5-ffe4e7b2cb4d.mock.pstmn.io**

## 🔧 Integration Steps Completed

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅
- Updated `.env.local` with your mock server URL
- Using `VITE_` prefix for Vite compatibility

### 2. API Service Integration ✅
- Created comprehensive API service layer
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for all data types
- Added proper error handling and response parsing

### 3. React Hooks Integration ✅
- Built custom hooks for all dashboard data
- Added loading states and error handling
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues

### 4. Dashboard Component Updates ✅
- Updated MentorDashboard to use API hooks
- Added loading spinners and error alerts
- Maintained all existing UI functionality

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### Option 1: Browser Test (Recommended)
1. Open `api-test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test All Endpoints" 
3. Check which endpoints are working

### Option 2: Dashboard Test
1. Your dev server is running at: **http://localhost:8081**
2. Navigate to the mentor dashboard
3. Check browser console for API calls
4. Look for data loading or error messages

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: CORS Errors
**Symptoms:** "fetch failed" or CORS policy errors in console
**Solution:** Postman mock servers should handle CORS automatically, but if you see these errors:
- Check that your mock server is active in Postman
- Verify the URL is exactly: `https://caea2572-638c-4052-b6d5-ffe4e7b2cb4d.mock.pstmn.io`

### Issue 2: 404 Not Found
**Symptoms:** Some endpoints return 404
**Solution:** The mock server might not have all endpoints configured
1. Open Postman
2. Check your collection "UnsaidTalks Dashboard API"
3. Verify all endpoints have example responses
4. Make sure the mock server is created from this collection

### Issue 3: Empty Responses
**Symptoms:** API calls succeed but return empty data
**Solution:** 
1. Check example responses in your Postman collection
2. Ensure each endpoint has realistic mock data
3. Verify the response structure matches TypeScript interfaces

## 🔄 Re-creating Mock Server (If Needed)

If your mock server isn't working properly:

1. **Import Collection**
   ```
   File → Import → postman/UnsaidTalks-Dashboard-API.postman_collection.json
   ```

2. **Create New Mock Server**
   ```
   Right-click collection → Mock Collection
   Name: UnsaidTalks Dashboard Mock
   Environment: Select imported environment
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```
   Update base_url with new mock server URL
   Update .env.local with new URL
   ```

## 📊 Expected API Responses

Your mock server should return data like this:

### Dashboard Stats
```json
{
  "totalMentees": 23,
  "activeSessions": 5,
  "averageRating": 4.9,
  "monthlyEarnings": 4250
}
```

### Upcoming Sessions
```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "sess_001",
      "menteeName": "Alex Johnson",
      "topic": "Career Transition",
      "date": "2025-09-21",
      "time": "2:00 PM"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** using the browser test tool
2. **Check Postman** to ensure your mock server is active
3. **Verify endpoints** have proper example responses
4. **Open the dashboard** at http://localhost:8081 to see live data

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you're still seeing issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Mock Server Status** in Postman
3. **Test Individual Endpoints** using the browser test tool
4. **Review Network Tab** in browser DevTools to see actual requests
